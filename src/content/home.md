I'm a **software generalist** based in Helsinki working in **Games Industy**, Finland.
Recently i became entusiastic about modern **javascript** and technologies like **React** and **Redux**. Previously I built some games with **Unity3D** and **iOS** apps with **swift** / **Objective-C** along with their **backend** and **Android** counterparts for quite some time.
When I'm not working on apps, I like **making games** at our own [Super Damage Games](http://superdamage.com)
