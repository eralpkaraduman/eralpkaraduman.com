I'm a **full stack mobile software developer** based in Helsinki, Finland.
Recently i became entusiastic about modern **javascript** and technologies like **React** and **Redux**. Previously I built **iOS** apps along with their **backend** and **Android** counterparts for quite some time.
When I'm not working on apps, I like **making games** at our own [Super Damage Games](http://superdamage.com)
