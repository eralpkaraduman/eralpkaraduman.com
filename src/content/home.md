I'm a **software generalist** based in Helsinki, Finland. Working in **Games Industy**.  

Recently i became enthusiastic about modern **javascript** and technologies like **NodeJS**, **TypeScript**, **React** and **Redux**.  

Previously I built **iOS** apps with **swift** / **Objective-C** along with their **backend** and **Android** counterparts for quite some time.  

When I'm not working on apps, I like **making games** with some games with **Unity3D** at our own [Super Damage Games](http://superdamage.com)
