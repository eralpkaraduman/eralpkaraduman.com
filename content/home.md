I'm a **full stack mobile software developer** based in Helsinki, Finland.  
I build mostly **iOS** apps along with their **backend** and **Android** counterparts.  
When I'm not working on apps, I like **making games** at our own [Super Damage Games](http://superdamage.com)

**I'm available for hire!**   
I've just recently shipped a new product,  
And now looking for the next exciting project to work on.

### About this site

I'm currently learning [golang](http://golang.org) as hobby and this site is my playground. It's basically very simple [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) clone, serving [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) content, It will eventually be a blog some day.  
It's [open source on github](http://github.com/eralpkaraduman/eralpkaraduman.com).  
Suggestions, contributions & criticism are more than welcome.
